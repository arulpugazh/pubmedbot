","One approach is serial blockface EM (SBEM), where a tissue sample is placed inside a scanning electron microscope outfitted with a microtome. The instrument images the blockface by backscattered electron scanning electron microscopy (SEM), removes a thin section, and repeats. According to Helmstaedter, who used SBEM in his retinal reconstruction, the process produces a somewhat more isotropic data set than separating the slicing and imaging steps, as Chklovskii did, which produces voxels measuring about 4 × 4×50nm.“Wegaveupalittlebiton x-y resolution, going for 15 or 16 nm,” he explains. “In z, however, we had 25 nm,” a thickness that makes it easier to trace fine neurite fibers.

25391911,Is there any animal whose neural wiring is documented,"Yes, nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans 
","Only one organism’s entire neuronal wiring has been traced, that of the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans. Sporting all 302 of neurons linked by some 7600 “synaptic connections,” the nematode connectome was published in 1986 in a mammoth 340-page treatise in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society by John White and colleagues in Sydney Brenner’s group in Cambridge, UK (1). The team built their map using serial section electron microscopy by encasing a worm in plastic, then making a series of trans- verse slices perpendicular to the animal’s long axis. Every third section, each about 50-nm thick, was photographed and printed onto a transparency.

22091864,How to get cheap SWNT antimicrobial coated surfaces ,"by significantly reducing the need of higher loads of SWNTs when embedding the SWNTs in the polymer PVK. 
","Overall, this study shows that SWNTs can be embedded into 
the electroactive polymer PVK to form stable PVK-SWNT nanocomposite dispersions and films. This mixture increased the dispersion and effective bacterial toxicity of SWNT into aqueous media and led to a more homogeneous coating of PVK-SWNT on ITO surfaces via electrodeposition. In both suspension and coated form, PVK-SWNT exhibited stronger antibacterial effects to E. coli and B. subtilis when compared to SWNT and PVK alone. PVK-SWNT, with only 3% SWNTs (0.03 mg/mL of SWNT), exhibited similar or stronger antibac- terial effects as compared with 100% SWNTs (1 mg/mL of SWNTs). Our study demonstrated for the first time that, by improving dispersibility of SWNT in solution, higher bacterial toxicity of SWNTs can be achieved. These results also demon- strated that it is possible to obtain more economical SWNT antimicrobial coated surfaces by significantly reducing the need of higher loads of SWNTs when embedding the SWNTs in the polymer PVK.

25624185,Who developed PHANToM haptic,Massie and Salisbury,"There are several general-purpose haptic hand-controllers
designed and commercialized currently by different com-
panies. The most commonly used haptic interface is possi-
bly the PHANToM haptic device, designed and developed
by Massie and Salisbury (22) at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, and now commercialized by Geomagic
(Rock Hill, USA). Different versions of the PHANToM hap-
tic device have been designed and developed for various
applications. The most economic version is the Geomagic®
Touch™ (formerly SensAble PHANToM Omni®), which
provides three DOFs of force feedback and six DOFs of
positional sensing. This haptic device is able to generate a
maximum force of 3.3 N with position resolution of
0.055 mm. The Geomagic® Touch™ X is an advanced
version of Touch™ and provides better position resolution
(0.023mm) and a maximum force up to 7.9N. The family
of Geomagic® PHANToM Premium™ models provides a
larger workspace, better position resolution and better
quality and range of force rendering. While the Touch™
family offers a range of motion corresponding to wrist rota-

30634639,How to prevent Robot kidnapping,a closed-loop localization mechanism to monitor the state of the robot in real time and make adaptive adjustments when the robot is kidnapped,"Additionally, to address the problem of robot kidnapping, we present a closed-loop localization mechanism to monitor the state of the robot in real time and make adaptive adjustments when the robot is kidnapped. The closed-loop mechanism effectively exploits the correlation of image sequences to realize the re-localization based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results indicate that the proposed method not only exhibits great improvement on accuracy and speed, but also can recover from localization failures compared to two conventional localization methods."
27669264,How to record LFPs,"intracortical electrode arrays
","Brain recordings can be broadly classiﬁed into two categories; the signals below 300 Hz are called LFPs and relate to increased brain activity in a particular area, while signals above 1000 Hz provide more detailed information on neural spikes [36]. To record neural spikes, the sampling rate should be set to 15 kSPS and above, while for LFPs acquisition, lower sampling rates are adequate. Using intracortical electrode arrays, single unit activity (SUA), multi-units activity (MUA) and LFP can be recorded while cortical surface electrodes enable recording of LFP and ECoG from the surface of the brain. LFP records the ﬁeld electrical potential from a small group of neurons. It records sensorimotor rhythms similar to ECoG, but with higher spatial resolution. Further, in order to analyze the integrative synaptic processes, LFP is the signal of interest instead of spikes, because synaptic processes cannot be captured by spike activity of a small number of neurons. During the past few decades, LFP has been used to study higher level cognitive processes involving attention, memory and perception [37–39], as well as to control prosthetic devices [40–42]. The LFP is also a promising indicator for monitoring neural activity, since the signal can be captured more easily and is more stable in chronic settings when
compared to spikes [43]."
27669264,How to measure LFP oscillations,vivo tests,"Thus, in this study, in vivo tests of the system were performed on a behaving monkey to record
his LFP oscillations. The system was tested by using electrodes implanted in the left hemisphere
primary motor cortex area to observe LFP oscillation that related to hand motion. The Utah Array
was connected to the external recording and stimulation units via a connector installed on the skull
during these measurements. The front-end ampliﬁer lower bandwidth was set to 0.1 Hz, and the
higher bandwidth was set to 1 kHz. An on board high-pass ﬁlter was enabled with a cutoff frequency
of 0.3 Hz to remove the residual DC offset voltages.

quently used in deep networks, was used for this purpose."
30714364,What can be a good alternative to Mercury,Gallium based liquid metals,"Today, gallium (Ga)-based liquid metals have emerged as a
viable and safer alternative to mercury, as the price of
production has dropped with increasing demand from the
semiconductor industry.6 The physicochemical properties of
LMs signiﬁcantly diﬀer from those of conventional solid
metals, therefore innovative processing is needed for their
robust and reliable integration in wearable devices. An
exhaustive review of LM-based soft and stretchable devices
and their applications was reported elsewhere.7 Despite
showing promising results, these devices still fail to be
deployed at large scale out of the laboratory environment.
Among the diﬀerent challenges, forming and patterning high
quality LM ﬁlms at the industrial scale requires understanding
and overcoming the limitations associated with the LM
unconventional rheology and wetting properties. In this
Account, we review the unique properties of Ga-based LMs,
e.g., complex rheology, high surface tension, solid oxide skin,
and reactivity with most metals, and report on diﬀerent
strategies that leverage these characteristics to create reversibly
deformable electronic components and circuits."

and 687.4 eV, corresponding to P 2s, S 2p, C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and
F 1s, respectively. Elements C (partially) and O were from the
MWNTs whereas P, S, N, F, and C (partially) were from the
viologenthiol of VSH. These XPS data further conﬁrmed the
formation of MWNT−VSH hybrids."
27376723,What can be used for data analysis in brain computer interfaces ,Principle component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) ,"Principle component analysis (PCA) and independent
component analysis (ICA) are widely used for data analysis
in brain computer interfaces. PCA converts linearly given a
set of correlated variables into a new one of uncorrelated
variables called principal components [9]. ICA creates a
coordinate system in order to ensure statistically indepen-
dent signals. It reduces the higher order dependencies of
signals on each other and assumes that measured signals
are a result of instantaneous linear mixtures of independent
sources [8]. Both of them reduce high dimensional data and
spatial redundancy. Support vector machine (SVM) and
artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) are two popular tools for
identifying signal patterns in various applications. They are
used properly to estimate functions on the large number of
inputs. SVM is constructed on a separating hyperplane as a
decision surface between two classes with a maximal
margin. ANN networks based on the large number of
processing elements called neurons [10]."

Afterward, the images were binarized using Otsu’s method [21], and the existing gaps were filled using an erosion morphological operator followed by a dilation one, using both a diamond structuring element of size 3. The resulting image was size-filtered using an opening morphological operator to eliminate remaining isolated pixels. In this way, a binary image stating the cytoplasm coverage was obtained, allowing the calculation of the total area covered by the cells or the mean area covered by each cell.

31341093,What is BCI,Brain Computer Interface,"Brain-computer interface (BCI) system provides an alternative pathway of human-
computer interface (HCI) [1].
The important applications of BCI are to analyze
the EEG signal for people with neuromuscular disabilities and understand their
intentions [2–4]. Among several BCI signal, P300 evoked potentials, steady-state
visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and motor imagery (MI) are the most popular
research paradigms of EEG signal analyzing, where MI is the only one based on
spontaneous potential without any external stimulus. MI is a mental process by
which an individual rehearses or simulates a given action [5]. For diﬀerent movement

spectrum of diﬀerent frequency bands."
31341093,How to extract motor imagery features,Common spatial patterns,"Pattern recognition plays one of the most important roles in EEG signal analyze.
Common spatial patterns (CSP) [7,8] is a popular method in extracting diﬀerent MI

PSS nanoﬁlms were used as working electrodes to electrodeposit polyaniline (PANI) in a mixed
alcohol solution of isopropyl alcohol (IPA), boron triﬂuoride ethyl ether (BFEE), and
polyethylene glycol (PEG). The thermoelectric (TE) performances of the resulting nanoﬁlms
were systematically investigated. SWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS/PANI nanoﬁlms showed a relatively
high electrical conductivity value of 232.0 S cm−1. The Seebeck coefﬁcient was enhanced and

27590972,What is EEG,ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY,"3.1 ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY
Even for healthy users, BCIs based on EEG are widely regarded as the most practical
for regular use (Chatelle et al., 2012, 2015; Naci et al., 2012; Nicolas-Alonso and
Gomez-Gil, 2012). EEG signals have a very high temporal resolution alongside a
minimally invasive acquisition protocol. Importantly, these signals can be acquired
from most individuals with minimal health risks. One of the only physical or medical
attributes of a person that would render EEG measurements uninformative is a skull
breach; EEG data acquired over a breached area of a skull are usually contaminated
by sharp, high-frequency bursts known as breach rhythm (Lee et al., 2010). Breach
rhythm occurs in some patients with DoC (eg, due to traumatic brain injury).

27590972,What are Sensorimotor rhythms ,"Sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) are oscillations in magnetic or electric fields recorded
over sensorimotor cortex in the mu (8–12 Hz), beta (18–30 Hz), and gamma
(30–200 Hz) frequency bands","3.1.1 Sensorimotor rhythms
Sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) are oscillations in magnetic or electric fields recorded
over sensorimotor cortex in the mu (8–12 Hz), beta (18–30 Hz), and gamma
(30–200 Hz) frequency bands (Jasper and Pendfield, 1949; Lopes da Silva, 1991;
Neuper and Pfurtscheller, 2001). An event-related desynchronization (ERD) is a
reduction in oscillatory activity related to a sensorimotor event (Pfurtscheller and
Aranibar, 1977). An increase in oscillatory activity known as an event-related syn-
chronization (ERS) can also occur, and this increase in activity may be a correlate of
a disinhibited/deactivated cortical network (Pfurtscheller, 1992).
Low-frequency mu ERDs (8–10 Hz) occur with almost any motor behavior and
are widespread over sensorimotor cortex (Pfurtscheller et al., 2000b). "
31331263,How does Distant Supervision method work,It automatically creates training instances by heuristically aligning facts in existing knowledge bases to free texts.,"Distant supervision (DS) provides a promising solution
to the scarcity of the training corpora. It automatically
creates training instances by heuristically aligning facts
in existing knowledge bases to free texts. Mintz et al.
[24] assumes that if two entities have a relationship in a
known knowledge base, then all sentences that contain
this pair of entities will express the relationship. Since its
emergence, distant supervision has been widely adopted
to information extraction in news domain [24] as well as
in biomedical text mining [25–28]. However, the original
assumption by Mintz et al. [24] does not always hold
and false-positive instances may be generated during
automatic instance construction procedure. The critical
issue in distant supervision is, therefore, how to filter
out these incorrect instances. Many methods have been
proposed to tackle this problem [30–33] and show
promising results in their respective settings, but few
[26–28] have demonstrated superiority in performance
over supervised ones on the benchmark corpora in the
biomedical domain."
30677307,What is a top-down approach in neurorehabilitation,"stimulate the brain in a more direct way to elicit plasticity-
mediated motor re-learning","Introduction: In recent years, neurorehabilitation has moved from a “bottom-up” to a “top down” 
approach. This change has also involved the technological devices developed for motor and 
cognitive rehabilitation. It implies that during a task or during therapeutic exercises, new “top-
down” approaches are being used to stimulate the brain in a more direct way to elicit plasticity-
mediated motor re-learning. This is opposed to “Bottom up” approaches, which act at the physical 
level and attempt to bring about changes at the level of the central neural system.  
Areas covered: In the present unsystematic review, we present the most promising innovative 
technological devices that can effectively support rehabilitation based on a top-down approach, 
according to the most recent neuroscientific and neurocognitive findings. In particular, we explore 
if and how the use of new technological devices comprising serious exergames, virtual reality, 
robots, brain computer interfaces, rhythmic music and biofeedback devices might provide a top-
down based approach.

level and attempt to bring about changes at the level of the central neural system.","Introduction: In recent years, neurorehabilitation has moved from a “bottom-up” to a “top down” 
approach. This change has also involved the technological devices developed for motor and 
cognitive rehabilitation. It implies that during a task or during therapeutic exercises, new “top-
down” approaches are being used to stimulate the brain in a more direct way to elicit plasticity-
mediated motor re-learning. This is opposed to “Bottom up” approaches, which act at the physical 
level and attempt to bring about changes at the level of the central neural system.  
Areas covered: In the present unsystematic review, we present the most promising innovative 
technological devices that can effectively support rehabilitation based on a top-down approach, 
according to the most recent neuroscientific and neurocognitive findings. In particular, we explore 
if and how the use of new technological devices comprising serious exergames, virtual reality, 
robots, brain computer interfaces, rhythmic music and biofeedback devices might provide a top-
down based approach.
