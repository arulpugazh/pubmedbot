Literature has conﬁrmed that Laplacian\nrecords are able to mitigate this effect and provide enhanced spatial resolution surface potential\nrecordings—i.e., they are able to improve the detection of the bioelectric dipole sources closest to the\nrecording electrodes, rejecting the contribution of distant bioelectric dipole sources—when compared to\nbipolar records made with disk electrodes [24]. First, surface Laplacian potentials were estimated using\nmonopolar disc electrodes and applying discretization techniques [26–28].

The global localization system consists of three parts: coarse place recognition, fine\nlocalization and re-localization from kidnapping. Coarse place recognition exploits a monocular\ncamera to realize the initial localization based on image retrieval, in which off-the-shelf features\nextracted from a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are adopted to determine the\ncandidate locations of the robot. In the fine localization, a laser range finder is equipped to estimate\nthe accurate pose of a mobile robot by means of an adaptive Monte Carlo localization, in which\nthe candidate locations obtained by image retrieval are considered as seeds for initial random\nsampling. Additionally, to address the problem of robot kidnapping, we present a closed-loop\nlocalization mechanism to monitor the state of the robot in real time and make adaptive adjustments\nwhen the robot is kidnapped. The closed-loop mechanism effectively exploits the correlation of\nimage sequences to realize the re-localization based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network",

The most commonly used haptic interface is possi-\nbly the PHANToM haptic device, designed and developed\nby Massie and Salisbury (22) at Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology, and now commercialized by Geomagic\n(Rock Hill, USA). Different versions of the PHANToM hap-\ntic device have been designed and developed for various\napplications. The most economic version is the Geomagic®\nTouch™ (formerly SensAble PHANToM Omni®), which\nprovides three DOFs of force feedback and six DOFs of\npositional sensing. This haptic device is able to generate a\nmaximum force of 3.3 N with position resolution of\n0.055 mm. The Geomagic® Touch™ X is an advanced\nversion of Touch™ and provides better position resolution\n(0.023mm) and a maximum force up to 7.9N. The family\nof Geomagic® PHANToM Premium™ models provides a\nlarger workspace, better position resolution and better\nquality and range of force rendering. While the Touch™\nfamily offers a range of motion corresponding to wrist rota-\ntion hand movement, the Premium™ family can provide a\nrange of motion equivalent to human wrist rotation hand\nmovement for the Premium™ 1.0, human elbow rotation\narm movement for the Premium™ 1.5, or human shoulder\nrotation arm movement for the Premium™ 3.0. A six-DOF\nversion of the latter two models (Premium™ 1.5 and 3.0)\nis also available. All commercially available PHANToM\nhaptic devices have a serial kinematic design, providing a\nlarge workspace but relatively less force compared to a\nparallel kinematic design.

In Vivo Test\nBrain recordings can be broadly classiﬁed into two categories; the signals below 300 Hz are called\nLFPs and relate to increased brain activity in a particular area, while signals above 1000 Hz provide\nmore detailed information on neural spikes [36]. To record neural spikes, the sampling rate should\nbe set to 15 kSPS and above, while for LFPs acquisition, lower sampling rates are adequate. Using\nintracortical electrode arrays, single unit activity (SUA), multi-units activity (MUA) and LFP can be\nrecorded while cortical surface electrodes enable recording of LFP and ECoG from the surface of the\nbrain. LFP records the ﬁeld electrical potential from a small group of neurons. It records sensorimotor\nrhythms similar to ECoG, but with higher spatial resolution. Further, in order to analyze the integrative\nsynaptic processes, LFP is the signal of interest instead of spikes, because synaptic processes cannot be\ncaptured by spike activity of a small number of neurons. During the past few decades, LFP has been\nused to study higher level cognitive processes involving attention, memory and perception [37–39],\nas well as to control prosthetic devices [40–42]. The LFP is also a promising indicator for monitoring\nneural activity, since the signal can be captured more easily and is more stable in chronic settings when\ncompared to spikes [43]",

[ 9 ] Gallium-based alloys, rather than toxic \nmercury, are widely used. The high surface tension and the pas-\nsivating oxide skin that spontaneously forms on the surface of \nthese liquids hinder their patterning using conventional tech-\nniques. Alternative methods focus on injection into channels, \nmolding and printing for rapid manufacturing of highly con-\nductive and stretchable metal networks but none of these pat-\nterning techniques offer high-resolution batch processing over \nlarge (wafer-scale) surface areas. [ 10 ] \nBased on these observations, we developed a new class of \nstretchable electronic conductors formed of biphasic solid–\nliquid thin metal ﬁ lms. A bilayer metallization sequence \nstarting with the sputtering of an alloying gold ﬁ lm followed \nby the thermal evaporation of liquid gallium (that displays a \nmelting point of 29.8 °C [ 11 ] ) results in a heterogeneous ﬁ lm \ncomposed of clusters of the solid intermetallic alloy AuGa 2 and \nsupercool liquid gallium forming a continuous network and dis-\npersed bulges [ 11b  , 12 ] ( Figure  1 a–c).

          "context": "3. Flexible and Implantable Microelectrodes\n3.1. Ultrasmall Microelectrodes\nThe initial implantation injury to the neural tissues is directly \nrelated to the cross-sectional footprint of the probes. The mean \nspacing of the blood microvessels in the rat brain has been \nshown to be ≈50 µm, and the mean distance between neu-\nrons and the closest microvessels was ≈15 µm.[6] Therefore, \nimplanted probes with a smaller cross-sectional footprint can \neffectively reduce damage to the blood vessels and the local \nneuronal environment. In addition, the bending stiffness of a \ncylindrical probe is described as:\nπ\n=\nk\nEd\nL\n3\n64\nB\n4\n3\n(1)\nwhere E is the elastic modulus, d is the cross-sectional dia-\nmeter, and L is the length of the electrode. Because the \nbending stiffness scales with the fourth power of the cross-\nsectional diameter, reducing the diameter of the probes can \nalso dramatically improve their mechanical compliance with \nbrain tissues. Kipke and co-workers developed an ultrasmall, \nimplantable carbon-fiber microelectrode with a cross-sectional \ndiameter of only 8.5 µm (Figure 2a, b).[11] The carbon-fiber \nmicroelectrode consists of a 7 µm diameter carbon fiber core \ncoated with 800 nm thick poly(p-xylylene) (parylene N) as \nthe dielectric insulation layer and 200 nm thick poly(ethylene \nglycol) methacrylate as the anti-biofouling layer. As a result, the \nstiffness of the carbon-fiber microelectrode is over an order of \nmagnitude smaller than that of a conventional silicon probe. A \nrecording site was exposed at the tip of the carbon-fiber micro-\nelectrode by cutting, and was electrochemically coated with \npoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulphonate) \n(PEDOT:PSS) for improved SNR (Figure 2c). Due to its ultr-\nasmall cross-sectional footprint and reduced stiffness, the \ncarbon-fiber microelectrode elicited limited bleeding after \nimplantation and greatly reduced reactive tissue responses two \nweeks post-implantation as compared with conventional sil-\nicon probes. Initial chronic recording studies in rats indicated \nthat the carbon-fiber microelectrode was able to detect single-\nunit activities for over five weeks. In the report by Cogan and \nco-workers, the electrodeposition of iridium oxide effectively \nreduced the impedance and improved the charge injection \ncapacities of carbon-fiber microelectrodes.[12] Furthermore, \nChestek and co-workers integrated 8.4 µm diameter carbon-\nfiber microelectrodes into 16-channel, 150 µm pitch arrays for \nmultisite recordings.[13] A poly(ethylene glycol) coating was \nused to temporarily increase the stiffness of the carbon fibers \nduring intracortical implantation. The carbon-fiber arrays were \nable to record single unit activities at 31 days post-implanta-\ntion in rats. A 16-channel carbon-fiber array with a total diam-\neter of 26 µm was prepared by Gardner and co-workers, which \nenabled multisite neural recording up to 3 months in singing \nbirds.[14] Recently, a carbon-fiber array was further assembled \nAdv.

EEG signals have a very high temporal resolution alongside a\nminimally invasive acquisition protocol. Importantly, these signals can be acquired\nfrom most individuals with minimal health risks. One of the only physical or medical\nattributes of a person that would render EEG measurements uninformative is a skull\nbreach; EEG data acquired over a breached area of a skull are usually contaminated\nby sharp, high-frequency bursts known as breach rhythm (Lee et al., 2010). Breach\nrhythm occurs in some patients with DoC (eg, due to traumatic brain injury)",
